# DataCollection
POSTECH CSED499II Research Project II

The goal of this project is to improve the performance of indoor positioning system using geomagnetic field by applying recurrent neural network to the localizing step.

This repository includes a failed attempt to tag the position of the measuring points automatically by using the UWB(Ultra-wideband) modules when colloecting data for constructing geomagnetic map. I had decieded to tag manually, so please see https://github.com/HyekyoungKim/DataCollectionManualTag for further work.
